# advance-wars
I am re-creating the Nintendo Game Boy Advance title, Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. This a project for fun and for practice developing games and software in general.

 I am using Godot Game Engine for this project, and teaching myself how to use it as I develop the game.

Once the game is featured enough to function I will add an explanation on how to use it.
